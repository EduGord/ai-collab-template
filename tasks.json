    "description": "The canonical agent model lacks fields for representing several key aspects observed in this project's agent framework. This task involves extending the canonical model to include these missing fields, enhancing its ability to represent complex agent-based systems. The extensions should cover:\n- Agent Dependencies: Add a field to track dependencies between agents, allowing for a clear representation of how agents interact and rely on each other within a system. This could be a list of agent IDs that a given agent depends on.\n- Agent Hierarchy and Specialized Roles: Introduce a mechanism to represent agent hierarchies and specialized roles. This could involve adding fields to indicate parent-child relationships between agents or to classify agents based on their specialized functions within the system (e.g., \"root orchestrator\", \"meta-agent\").\n- Operational Procedures and Decision-Making Parameters: Incorporate fields for defining operational procedures and decision-making parameters, such as checklists, heuristics, preferences, and scoring mechanisms. This could involve adding structured data types to represent these concepts, allowing for a more detailed and configurable representation of an agent's behavior.\n- Execution Metrics: Include fields for capturing execution metrics, such as token usage, estimated costs, and execution history. This would provide valuable insights into the resource utilization and operational efficiency of agents.\n- User Interface (UI) Aspects: Add fields to specify user interface (UI) aspects of agents, such as UI elements, visual priority, and feedback loop settings. This would allow for a more complete representation of agents that interact directly with users.\nImpacted Components: This task will primarily impact the definition of the agent model itself. However, it may also require updates to documentation, tools, and processes that utilize the agent model.",

This task involves creating comprehensive documentation that clearly outlines these project-specific conventions for defining agents. The documentation should cover:\n- File Structure and Naming Conventions: Explain the purpose and content of each file used to define an agent (e.g., `agent-metadata.json`, `identity.json`, `agent-ledger.json`, `agent-state.json`, `lifecycle.json`, `checklist.json`, `heuristics.json`, `ux-profile.json`) and the conventions for naming these files.\n- Data Formats and Field Definitions: Provide detailed descriptions of the data formats and fields used within each file, including examples and explanations of any project-specific extensions or modifications to standard data types.\n- Relationships and Interactions between Files: Clarify how the different files relate to each other and how they collectively define an agent's characteristics, behavior, and operational context.\n- Best Practices and Guidelines: Offer best practices and guidelines for creating and maintaining agent definitions within the project, ensuring consistency and clarity across all agents.\nImpacted Components: This task will primarily impact the project's documentation.

This task aims to standardize the checklist structure across all agents, adopting the more organized approach of the `core-checklist.json` format. This will involve:\n- Migrating Basic Checklists: Converting the basic checklists in `checklist.json` files to the structured format of `core-checklist.json` files. This will include adding a title, specifying related files (if applicable), and restructuring the check items into a more formal representation.\n- Ensuring Consistency: Establishing a convention that all agents, regardless of their complexity, use the standardized `core-checklist.json` format for defining their operational procedures and checks.\nImpacted Components: This task will require modifications to the checklist files for all agents.

Consider how the more detailed agent definitions (including checklists, heuristics, and operational metrics) could be leveraged to enhance the memory bank's content and organization.
