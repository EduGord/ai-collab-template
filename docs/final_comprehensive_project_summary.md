# Final Project Summary: Canonical AI-Human Collaboration Framework

## Mission

Build a modular, extensible project for interacting with LLMs and agents that:
- Supports evolving tasks
- Overcomes context limitations
- Integrates memory, reflection, and logging
- Maintains long-term coherence

## Architecture

- Canonical Data Models
- Extensible Agent Specs
- Pipeline and Routine Orchestration
- File Routing and Metadata Indexing
- Memory Bank and Resumability Engine

## Built-in Agents

- `orchestrator-agent` – Alignment Guardian
- `bootstrap-agent` – Memory and Init Seeding
- `router-agent` – File and Task Routing
- `logger-agent` – Structured Log Recorder
- `ux-agent` – Human-Centric Observer
- `realtime-llm-assistant` – This AI assistant acting as your system brain

## System Capabilities

- Run evolution cycles with memory + feedback
- Simulate agent pipelines
- Track logs, sync memory, resume pipelines
- Build and audit new agents
