# Memory + Runner Module

## 🧠 memory_service.py
Provides abstraction for storing logs, loading tasks, and simulating persistent AI memory.

## 🔁 pipeline_runner.py
Simulates execution of tasks by routing them to logical agents.

## 🚀 main.py
Entry point for launching agent execution. Initializes memory and begins pipeline dispatch.

## Next Steps
- Move from stub to real file/db-backed memory ops
- Support CLI or API injection of new tasks
- Allow LLMs to invoke and inspect memory/logs live
