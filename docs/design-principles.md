# Design Principles

This template embodies the following concepts:
- Memory-guided interaction
- Reflective agents and feedback loops
- Schema-driven routines and pipelines
- Modular, audit-ready system design

It is built from scratch to help LLMs and humans efficiently collaborate over long and complex sessions.

## Canonical Data Models

The `/schemas/canonical-agent-model.json` schema provides a foundational contract to unify agent identity, lifecycle, and operational boundaries.
