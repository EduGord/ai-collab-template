# Evaluation Results (Updated)

## Recent Agent Actions
- [system] Registered pipeline runner for task-agent execution.
- [system] Full system audit completed: memory, routines, docs, identities, checklists, tasks all synchronized.
- [system] Agents `feedbacker`, `forecaster`, `planner` registered.
- [planner] Initialized intent-based task flow.
- [forecaster] Task dependency graphing simulated for project planning.

## Summary
Agents are performing well with logs, memory, and routine generation. Planner, Forecaster, and Feedbacker now operational.

### Simulated Pipeline Feedback
- Task `wh-sim-001`: Webhook-to-agent-to-feedback loop successful


## [Cycle - Full Routine Sweep]

### Actions Performed:
- `planner`: All tasks reviewed for metadata compliance ✅
- `docbot`: Identity backlinks validated and cross-linked ✅
- `schemaenforcer`: Config strictness enforced on 2 files ✅
- `feedbacker`: No repeated log issues or conflicts detected ✅
- `forecaster`: Predictions logged, all on track ✅
- `realtime-llm-assistant`: JSON output validated, ready for downstream consumption ✅

Framework is now mission-aligned, introspective, and agent-resilient.

## [Agent Execution Evaluation]
- planner: ✅ Passed all checklist steps and executed pipeline as expected.
- schemaenforcer: ✅ Passed all checklist steps and executed pipeline as expected.
- docbot: ✅ Passed all checklist steps and executed pipeline as expected.
- feedbacker: ✅ Passed all checklist steps and executed pipeline as expected.
- forecaster: ✅ Passed all checklist steps and executed pipeline as expected.

## [Observability Metrics Validation]
- forecaster: log_fidelity_check — complete
- feedbacker: log_fidelity_check — complete
