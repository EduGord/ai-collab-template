# Feedback Summary â€” v17 Roadmap Execution

## Agent Execution Overview
- **docbot** created onboarding documentation (internal only)
- **planner** improved task clarity through auto-grouping
- **schemaenforcer** locked schema rules to version-aware state
- **feedbacker** summarized this exact feedback
- **llm-assistant** activated dynamic rerouting logic

## Observations
- Agent autonomy is stable and reproducible
- Routing metadata is consistent
- Logs are now consistently tagged

## Next Recommendation
Trigger a new discovery loop: let agents define the next major evolution goal via intent-based generation.
