## README Files
- `README.md`: Consider linking or merging with specialized READMEs.
- `README-LLM.md`: Good agent guidance. Suggest adding versioned metadata tags.

## Code
- `tests/test_core.py`: Basic test scaffold exists. Add assertions for core behavior.
- `src/` folder is empty or missing logic files. Populate with core modules to unlock full agent workflows.

## Configs
- `config/llm-context-router.json`: Validate format and routing keys. Consider adding schema reference.
