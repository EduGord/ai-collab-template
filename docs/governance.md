# Governance

This framework operates under agent-guided protocols with memory-based execution and logging.
All actions must trace back to tasks, routines, or plans, governed by the following:

## Rules
- All agents must log actions via `log()`
- No task may run without identity, scope, and routine context
- Changes to docs, plans, or schemas must be versioned and logged

## Objectives
- Provide transparency for every action
- Enable auditability and reproducibility
- Empower intent-driven, autonomous agent behavior
