# Long-Term Plan

## Phase 1: Bootstrapping (DONE)
- Scaffold memory, task, agent, doc, routine systems
- Build validator, runner, executor logic

## Phase 2: Integration (CURRENT)
- Add CLI support, dashboards, agent status tracking
- Simulate LLM execution and memory sync

## Phase 3: Scaling
- Introduce external agent plugins
- Build interactive task editor
- Add networked memory layers

---
## Forecast
This system aims to be the canonical agent framework template for projects collaborating with LLMs at scale.
