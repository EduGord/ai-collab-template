# Context Coherence Loop

To prevent context drift:

1. Each agent must update router and memory index after adding files
2. A validator and linter must be run after each plan
3. A self-healing routine must auto-fix any discovered gaps
4. Reflection must be logged on audit failures
5. A version bump should trigger introspection
