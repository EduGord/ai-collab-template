# CLI System Improvements

## ✅ CLI Simulated Mode
A new toggle enables simulated CLI execution for dry runs, onboarding, and previews.
Use `--simulated` or environment config `CLI_SIMULATED=true`.

## ✅ Onboarding Helper
Helpful CLI guide generated at first run or with `--help-onboard`.

## ✅ Test Cases
Common CLI scenarios are now covered via simulation tests to verify end-to-end behavior.

## ✅ UX Polish
Prompt interactions, fallback handling, and input UX have been refined.

All changes are reflected in CLI pipelines and logs included in the release manifest.
