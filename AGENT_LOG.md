## ✅ Framework Resilience Upgrade — Release Safety Protocols (Auto-Appended)

### Summary:
- Integrated `.releaseignore` + ZIP logic
- Scrubbed all timestamps using `timestamp_scrubber.py`
- Removed all volatile folders via `clean_release_artifacts.py`
- Created safety task: `task-verify-release-footprint.json`
- Created checklist: `checklists/release-checklist.yaml`
- Release ZIPs are now generated via `generate_clean_zip.py`
- Core framework artifacts verified preserved

### Timestamp:
Framework action completed without datestamps to remain session-portable.
