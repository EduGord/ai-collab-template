# Design & Architecture Execution Log

## Completed
- README.md now serves as central hub, links to agent- and human-specific docs
- Context router schema validated and documented in `docs/router-schema-reference.md`
- Folder structure verified: `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `config/`

## Motivation
Ensure framework is intuitive, maintainable, and ready for agent-driven extension

## State
Fully structured, agent-routable, and architecture aligned for further extensibility
