# AI Collab Framework â€“ Mission Alignment Report

## ðŸ§­ Original Project Mission
Create a **template project** that:
- Guides interaction between **AI and User**
- Solves the **context window limitation** for LLMs
- Builds persistent **memory**, **logs**, **routines**, and **pipelines**
- Enables **agent collaboration** with long-task logging and resume capability
- Improves **efficiency**, **traceability**, and **real-world project scalability**
- Allows agents to work with files and directories at various abstraction levels via a **file routing system**

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Difficulties to Address
- Limited context memory in LLMs
- Fragmented toolchain across local/cloud agents
- Forgetfulness and inefficiency in large project collaboration

## âœ… Current System Capabilities (Validated)
- âœ… **Memory Bank** with structured markdown entries per task, goal, agent state
- âœ… **Logs** tracked in `AGENT_LOG.md` to capture each agent's task result and progress
- âœ… **Agents** with defined identity, scope, trust level, and behavior
- âœ… **Checklists** linked to task execution state
- âœ… **Tasks.json** with fine-grained priority-tagged items
- âœ… **Pipelines** linking file triggers to agents and logs
- âœ… **Routines** (weekly maintenance, test audit, coverage scan, schema check)
- âœ… **Documentation** centralized in `PROJECT-TASKS.md`, `framework-capabilities.md`
- âœ… **README entrypoint** defined and linked to all support docs
- âœ… **Context routing system** implemented (`llm-context-router.json`, `router-schema-reference.md`)

## ðŸ”§ Additional Concepts Integrated
- âœ… Canonical Data Models: extensible routing schema
- âœ… File Routing: config-based and documented
- âœ… Long-task audit: logs and resumable pipelines
- âœ… Modular agents able to "read each other's logs" and resume actions

| Concept                          | Implemented | Notes                                                  |
|----------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Memory bank                      | âœ…           | `framework/memory/` folder active and updated         |
| Logging layer                    | âœ…           | All tasks/actions logged in `AGENT_LOG.md`            |
| Agent identity + checklists      | âœ…           | Used by `docbot`, `structurekeeper`, etc.             |
| File routing system              | âœ…           | `config/llm-context-router.json` + documented schema  |
| Pipeline architecture            | âœ…           | `agent-task-pipeline.yaml` routes triggers to agents  |
| Routine scheduling               | âœ…           | `project-maintenance-sweep.yaml` active               |
| Persistent context + task state  | âœ…           | Memory, logs, and resumable entries work as expected  |

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps
- Auto-versioning per execution state
- Live memory snapshot log
- Integration with external agent clients
- Launch agent federation model (logs-as-input)

This framework matches the mission. All core goals from the original vision have been integrated into executable, agent-aware infrastructure.
