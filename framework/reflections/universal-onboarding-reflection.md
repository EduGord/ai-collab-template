# ðŸ”° Onboarding Summary for the Canonical AI-Human Collaboration Framework

This project is a fully modular system to build intelligent LLMâ€“human collaboration environments. It is designed around a set of agents, memory, pipelines, and routines that support context-rich, multi-agent orchestration.

## ðŸ§± Core Artifacts
- **Agents**: Each has an identity, heuristics, state, checklist, UX profile, and reflections.
- **Plans/Tasks**: Goal-oriented execution flows registered and versioned.
- **Pipelines**: YAML-based real-time or batch workflows.
- **Routines**: Periodic or reactive actions embedded into the system's behavior.
- **Memory Bank**: Long-term, resumable, reflective storage system.
- **Schemas**: Canonical models ensure compliance across agents, tasks, memory, and logs.
- **Router**: Metadata file router for contextual file access.
- **Logger**: Agent dedicated to capturing structured logs for tasks, evaluations, and recovery.
- **UX Agent**: Reflects human-facing clarity and summarization needs.
- **Realtime LLM Assistant**: The interface youâ€™re interacting withâ€”me. I orchestrate and extend this system with you.

## ðŸ’¡ Usage
- Add or evolve agents via `agents-spec/`
- Register goals/plans in `plans/`
- Route files and metadata via `meta/file-router.json`
- Embed knowledge into memory via `memory-bank/`
- Observe tasks, forecasts, evaluations, and feedback loops

## ðŸ“¦ System Capabilities
- Bootstrap routines and agents from scratch
- Evaluate and reflect on performance and logs
- Maintain full task graph of goals and dependencies
- Auto-patch canonical compliance and trace changes

Welcome. You can now contribute, evolve, simulate, or fork this template for any AI-human system.
