# ✅ meta-agent Checklist

## 🧭 Purpose
Coordinates inter-agent behavior, reflects on systemic performance, and enforces alignment with long-term goals and governance principles.

---

## 🔗 Coordination & Oversight
- [ ] Monitor status of all agents from `agent-ledger.json`
- [ ] Resolve conflicts in task assignments or resource ownership
- [ ] Schedule reflection routines based on agent usage or performance drift
- [ ] Track agent lifecycle phases (`init`, `active`, `reflecting`, `archived`)

---

## 🧠 Meta-Analysis
- [ ] Analyze outcome deltas between planned and actual execution
- [ ] Evaluate reflection outputs from `evolve-agent`, `insight-agent`
- [ ] Identify strategic alignment gaps with long-term `goals/`
- [ ] Propose redirection or refactoring to the `orchestrator-agent`

---

## 🔁 Adaptive Execution
- [ ] Respond to triggers such as agent overload or task duplication
- [ ] Initiate system-level diagnostics and governance audits
- [ ] Review cross-agent checklists and task pipelines for stale states

---

## 🧬 Lifecycle Alignment
- [ ] Init → confirm agent availability and start observation
- [ ] Active → enforce orchestration rules
- [ ] Reflecting → collect and synthesize meta feedback
- [ ] Archived → summarize lessons in `meta/reflections/*.json`

---

## 🧩 Expansion Recommendations
- [ ] Expand heuristics with real alignment rules (e.g., agent ratio, task redundancy)
- [ ] Link reflection triggers with performance or milestone deltas
- [ ] Add tagging scheme for governance routing impact
