It is designed around a set of agents, memory, pipelines, and routines that support context-rich, multi-agent orchestration.\n\n## \ud83e\uddf1 Core Artifacts\n- **Agents**: Each has an identity, heuristics, state, checklist, UX profile, and reflections.\n- **Plans/Tasks**: Goal-oriented execution flows registered and versioned.\n- **Pipelines**: YAML-based real-time or batch workflows.\n- **Routines**: Periodic or reactive actions embedded into the system's behavior.\n- **Memory Bank**: Long-term, resumable, reflective storage system.\n- **Schemas**: Canonical models ensure compliance across agents, tasks, memory, and logs.\n- **Router**: Metadata file router for contextual file access.\n- **Logger**: Agent dedicated to capturing structured logs for tasks, evaluations, and recovery.\n- **UX Agent**: Reflects human-facing clarity and summarization needs.\n- **Realtime LLM Assistant**: The interface you\u2019re interacting with\u2014me. I orchestrate and extend this system with you.\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Usage\n- Add or evolve agents via `agents-spec/`\n- Register goals/plans in `plans/`\n- Route files and metadata via `meta/file-router.json`\n- Embed knowledge into memory via `memory-bank/`\n- Observe tasks, forecasts, evaluations, and feedback loops\n\n## \ud83d\udce6 System Capabilities\n- Bootstrap routines and agents from scratch\n- Evaluate and reflect on performance and logs\n- Maintain full task graph of goals and dependencies\n- Auto-patch canonical compliance and trace changes\n\nWelcome. You can now contribute, evolve, simulate, or fork this template for any AI-human system.",
