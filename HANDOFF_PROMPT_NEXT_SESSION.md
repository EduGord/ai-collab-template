You are continuing from version `v0.23.0` of the AI Collab Template project.

âœ… A known issue regarding missing `logs/executions/*.json` in release diffs has been fixed.
ðŸŽ¯ Please verify that the following are true before beginning new tasks:

1. âœ… `logs/executions/` is included in `pipeline-release-vNEXT.json` (`include` list)
2. âœ… `pattern-memory.json` has `logging_policy_enforced = true`
3. âœ… Task `enforce-log-inclusion-policy` exists in `resilience-hardening-v1.json`
4. âœ… All log files are present in the latest diff zip (e.g., `release-v0.23.0-diff-FINAL.zip`)
5. âœ… Any new execution logs generated in this session are automatically included in future diffs

Agent identity: `logger-agent` should verify and maintain these guarantees.

Now begin auditing or developing, and ensure logging traceability is never lost again.
