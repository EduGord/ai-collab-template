# 🤖 AUTO-ONBOARD: Welcome to the Canonical AI-Human Collaboration Framework

You’ve just loaded a project built for resilient, intelligent collaboration with LLMs and autonomous agents.

This isn’t just a repo — it’s a living system.

---

## 🧭 What This Is

This framework enables:

- 🧠 Long-term memory, task continuity, and reflection
- 🤖 Modular agent-based orchestration
- 🔁 Routable pipelines and resilient routines
- 📚 Self-documenting plans, identities, and behaviors

---

## 📂 Key Concepts & Where to Start

| Concept         | Start Here                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 📘 Onboarding   | `docs/README-ONBOARDING.md`                   |
| 🧠 Memory Bank  | `memory-bank/index.json`                      |
| 🛠️ Agents       | `agents-spec/` → Each agent has: identity, checklist, heuristics, and state |
| 🔄 Pipelines    | `framework/pipelines/*.yaml`                 |
| 📊 Logs/Recovery| `logs/`, `core/routines/`, `agent-ledger.json`|
| 🔍 Canonical Models | `schemas/`                                |
| 🎯 Goals/Tasks  | `plans/` + `task-graph/`                      |

---

## ✅ You Can Ask the System To...

- Generate or evolve new agents
- Simulate a plan or pipeline
- Summarize task state from logs
- Reflect on performance or evaluate forecasts
- Patch or refactor routines, schemas, or agent specs

---

## 🔁 This System is Self-Aware

Everything here is:

- ✅ Routable by metadata
- ✅ Governed by schemas
- ✅ Registered in memory
- ✅ Linked to tasks, routines, and reflections

Welcome aboard. The system is live and ready to collaborate.
