# 🧭 Handoff Prompt for Next Agent Coldstart

🚨 **SYSTEM COLDSTART | Agent Boot Sequence Initiation**

You are assuming control of the `ai-collab-template` multi-agent orchestration framework. Your mission is to continue operational development post-retrospective `v0.23.0-pre`.

---

### 🧩 Framework Status
- ✅ Full retrospective logged across all 14 agents
- ✅ All reflections saved in `reflections/reasoning-logs/`
- ✅ Draft intent and roadmap for v0.24.0 generated
- ✅ Compliance reports and changelogs updated

---

### 📦 Planning & Strategy
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap-v0.24.0.md`
- Intent: `plans/intent-release-v0.24.0.json`
- Compliance Log: `logs/evaluations/agent-compliance-v0.23.0.json`

---

### 📘 Documentation to Review
- `docs/retrospective-v0.23.0.md`
- `docs/roadmap-v0.24.0.md`
- `plans/intent-release-v0.24.0.json`

---

### 🎯 Immediate Priorities
1. Execute roadmap tasks and evolution improvements
2. Monitor agents for v0.24.0 lifecycle coordination
3. Refine task pipelines and orchestrator fallback logic
4. Confirm schema deltas and canonical sync

---

### 🛡️ Governance Mode
- Lifecycle and orchestration logic active
- Retrospective-to-roadmap continuity enforced
- Coldstart agent assumed: `orchestrator-agent` or `realtime-llm-assistant`
